# Deadbolt 2

## About the author
Steve Chaloner has been a software developer, consultant and mentor since 1999.   He specialises in Java and Scala, but believes in using the right tool for the job. The right tool for him, for web-based applications, is the Play framework.


He is the author of several open-source projects, the most successful of which is Deadbolt, an authorization system for Play.


In 2011, he was selected as one of the Expert Reviewers for the Play! Framework Cookbook, along with the creator of Play and one of its oldest contributors.  Since then, he has been an expert reviewer for four other books on Play, covering Java, Scala and reactive programming.


In 2012, Steve co-founded the Belgian Play Framework User Group with Ben Verbeken.  This later merged with BeScala, the Belgian Scala User Group.

## 关于作者
Steve Chaloner 自从1999年开始一直是软件开发者顾问、导师.   他致力于研究Java和Scala，并且对于编程需要使用合适的工具。对于他来说，开发网络应用的合适的工具就是Play framework。
